            The Beginning
          </h1>
          <p class="about-us-section mt-4">
            It all started back in 2014. We were super happy writting our very first services with Akka and Scala,
            doing concurrency like never before (literally) until the D day came: we were ready to deploy to production
            and only then we discovered that there was no simple, performant and reliable way to get metrics out of the
            services we just wrote. We searched, we asked around and we found nothing, so we decided to build something
            that could <strong>help</strong> solve this problem.
          </p>

          <p class="about-us-section mt-4">
            During this process we noticed that we were not alone on this; there were several teams around the world
            facing the very same problems we had so there was only one natural thing to do, <strong>share</strong> what
            we built, an so Kamon was born!

            And then, APM
          </h1>

          <p class="about-us-section mt-4">
            As time passed and we grew more fond of monitoring, we started to notice how all our effort on the
            instrumentation side was usually being transformed into a few statistical summaries on a dashboard that said
            very little about the true behavior of an application. Our frustration with this lead us to build a platform
            that at it's very core could store an application's behavior in the same level of detail as Kamon can gather
            it, so Kamon APM was born.
          </p>
          <p class="about-us-section mt-4">
            Fast forward to today, Kamon APM is no longer just about metrics! We are enabling teams around the world to
            to see the true behavior of their services with both metrics and distributed tracing, get alerts when things
            go wrong and discover issues across microservices. And we are just getting started!

            LOL. No. You know that situation where it takes forever to start your next project because you need to
            choose an awesome name? We skipped that and went for Ak<strong>ka Mon</strong>nitoring. It caught up and here
            we are!
