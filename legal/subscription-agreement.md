# Service Subscription Agreement
### (Version 1.0) - Effective Since August 15th, 2018

</div>

This Service Subscription Agreement (the “Agreement”) contains the terms and conditions that govern the access to and use of the Service (the “Service”) and is an Agreement between **Kamino Technologies d.o.o.** (“us”, “we”, or “our”) and **you** or the entity you represent (“you” or “your”). This Agreement takes effect when you click an “I Accept” button or checkbox presented with these terms or, if earlier, when you use the Service. You represent that you are lawfully able to enter into contracts (e.g. you are not a minor). If you are entering into this Agreement for an entity, such as the company you work for, you represent to us that you have legal authority to bind that entity.

Please read this Agreement carefully before using the Service. Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who access or use the Service.

By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by this Agreement. If you disagree with any part of this Agreement then you may not access or use the Service.

### 1. Access to the Service
**1.1 Account and Authorized Users**. To access the Service, you must have an Account associated with a valid email address. You may invite additional Accounts to become Authorized Users within your organization. You may only create one account per email address. You are responsible for all activities that occur under your Account, including those carried out by any Authorized Users associated with your Account.

**1.2 Accurate Account Information**. When you create an Account with us, you must provide us information that is accurate, complete, and current at all times. Failure to do so constitutes a breach of this Agreement, which may result in immediate termination of your Account on our Service.

**1.3 Account Security**. You are responsible for safeguarding and maintaining the confidentiality of your Account, including any API keys we provide to you that enable you to send data to the Service (“API Keys”) and the credentials of your and any Authorized User’s Account used to access the Service. You agree not to disclose your credentials to any third party and you agree to promptly notify us upon becoming aware of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your Account.

**1.4 Requirements**. You shall be solely responsible for providing, installing and maintaining at your own expense all equipment, facilities and services necessary to enable Authorized Users' access and use of the Service as well as enabling the collection and submission of your Data to the Service.

**1.5 Beta Services or Features**. From time to time, we may invite you to try our beta services or features under development (“Beta Services or Features”) at no charge. You may accept or decline any such trial at your sole discretion. Beta Services or Features will be clearly designated as beta, pilot, limited release, developer preview, non-production, evaluation or by a description of similar import. Beta Services or Features are for evaluation purposes only and not for production use, are not considered part of the Service under this Agreement, are not supported, and may be subject to additional terms. We may discontinue Beta Services or Features at any time at our sole discretion and may never make them generally available. We will have no liability for any harm or damage arising out of or in connection with a Beta Service or Feature.

### 2. Free Trial

**2.1 Term**. Upon registration on our Service, we will make the Service available to you on a trial basis free of charge until the earlier of (a) the end of the free trial period, or (b) termination by us in our sole discretion.
Data Persistence. Any data you enter into the Service and any configurations made by or for you during the trial period will be permanently lost unless you provide us with a valid payment method and billing information to collect the Service usage fees and charges as described on Section 3 of this Agreement.

**2.2 Service Availability and Guarantees**. During the Free Trial term the Service is provided on an “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” basis, without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement or course of performance. During the Free Trial term we do not warrant that the Service will function uninterrupted, error free, secure or available at any particular time or location, and that any errors or defects will be corrected.

### 3. Service Fees and Payments

**3.1 Fees**. We will calculate and invoice you the fees and charges for Service usage every month. The fees and charges amount is calculated in accordance to the specifications and prices described on the pricing page on our website (https://kamon.io/apm/pricing/). We will notify you at least 30 days before the effective date of any price change that might affect the calculation of your fees and charges for use of the Service.

**3.2 Invoicing and Payments**. You agree to pay us the applicable fees and charges for Service usage by using a credit card or direct transfer to one of our bank accounts. All amounts payable by you under this agreement will be paid to us in full, without any deduction or withholding. In the case of choosing a credit card as payment method, you agree to provide us with valid and updated credit card information and you authorize us to charge such credit card for all fees and charges incurred on a monthly basis and until the termination of this Agreement. All invoiced fees and charges are due 15 days from the invoice date.

**3.3 Prepaid Commitments**. You may place an order for a specific capacity for usage of the Service and pay for it in advance. Once you place such order and the related payments have been received, your monthly fees and charges during the term of the order will only include fees and charges incurred in excess of the prepaid capacity. All fees and charges for prepaid commitment are non-refundable, with the exception of the termination provisions of Section 5.2 of this Agreement.

**3.4 Overdue Charges and Suspension of Service**. If any invoiced amount is not received by us by the due date, then without limiting our rights and remedies we may suspend your access to the Service until such amounts are paid in full. We will give you at least 10 days of prior notice that your account is overdue before proceeding to suspend your access to the Service.

**3.6 Taxes**. Our fees do not include any taxes, levies, duties or similar governmental assessments of any nature, including, for example, value-added, sales, use or withholding taxes, assessable by any jurisdiction whatsoever (collectively, “Taxes”). You are responsible for paying all Taxes associated with your purchases hereunder. If we have the legal obligation to pay or collect Taxes for which you are responsible, we will invoice you and you will pay that amount unless you provide us with a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority.

### 4. Service Availability and Support

### 9. Confidentiality

**9.1 Definition**. “Confidential Information” means all information disclosed by a party (“Disclosing Party”) to the other party (“Receiving Party”), whether orally or in writing, that is designated as confidential or that reasonably should be understood to be confidential given the nature of the information and the circumstances of disclosure. Your Confidential Information includes Your Data; Our Confidential Information includes the Service and Content; and Confidential Information of each party includes the terms and conditions of this Agreement and all orders (including pricing), as well as business and marketing plans, technology and technical information, product plans and designs, and business processes disclosed by such party. However, Confidential Information does not include any information that (i) is or becomes generally known to the public without breach of any obligation owed to the Disclosing Party, (ii) was known to the Receiving Party prior to its disclosure by the Disclosing Party without breach of any obligation owed to the Disclosing Party, (iii) is received from a third party without breach of any obligation owed to the Disclosing Party, or (iv) was independently developed by the Receiving Party.

**9.2 Obligations**. The Receiving Party will use the same degree of care that it uses to protect the confidentiality of its own confidential information of like kind (but not less than reasonable care) to (i) not use any Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party for any purpose outside the scope of this Agreement and (ii) except as otherwise authorized by the Disclosing Party in writing, limit access to Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to those of its and its Affiliates’ employees and contractors who need that access for purposes consistent with this Agreement and who have signed confidentiality agreements with the Receiving Party containing protections not materially less protective of the Confidential Information than those herein. Neither party will disclose the terms of this Agreement or any orders to any third party other than its Affiliates, legal counsel and accountants without the other party’s prior written consent, provided that a party that makes any such disclosure to its Affiliate, legal counsel or accountants will remain responsible for such Affiliate’s, legal counsel’s or accountant’s compliance with Section 8 of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may disclose the terms of this Agreement and any applicable order to a subcontractor or third-party service provider to the extent necessary to perform our obligations to you under this Agreement, under terms of confidentiality materially as protective as set forth herein.

**9.3 Compelled Disclosure**. The Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to the extent compelled by law to do so, provided the Receiving Party gives the Disclosing Party prior notice of the compelled disclosure (to the extent legally permitted) and reasonable assistance, at the Disclosing Party's cost, if the Disclosing Party wishes to contest the disclosure. If the Receiving Party is compelled by law to disclose the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information as part of a civil proceeding to which the Disclosing Party is a party, and the Disclosing Party is not contesting the disclosure, the Disclosing Party will reimburse the Receiving Party for its reasonable cost of compiling and providing secure access to that Confidential Information.
