Getting Help
=============

If you ever experience issues, need help, or have other questions or requests, do not be afraid to reach out to us. You can do so by clicking on the question mark icon in the sidebar, on the bottom left. This will open the Help menu.

**Chat with Us** will open a message prompt, where you can talk to us and get your issues resolved, or browse through previous conversations you've had with us. We usually respond in up to a day, and sometimes much faster for urgent issues.

**Read the Docs** will take you back here! Not all problems require outside help, sometimes the documentation answers the questions we need.

**Schedule a Support Session** is for when you have a more complex issue and need to have a video call with somebody from the Kamon team.
