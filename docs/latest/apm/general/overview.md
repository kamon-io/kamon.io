Kamon APM
===========

Overview
--------

[Kamon APM][apm] is a hosted monitoring and debugging platform for microservices, designed from the ground up with one goal in mind: accept all the metrics and tracing data exactly as Kamon Telemetry records it. No averaging, no pre-aggregating, no downsampling of metrics, no data quality loss. This policy of seamless integration with Kamon Telemetry translates into better, accurate and relevant alerts and insight on your applicationâ€™s behavior.

With Kamon APM, you can [deep dive][analyze] into the metrics your services send and get auto-detection of unusual deviations, use [traces] to analyze performance bottlenecks and errors, see the layout of your microservice architecture using the [Service Map]. When your system is behaving unusually, you can set up [alerts] to receive reports to your e-mail, Slack, or elsewhere. If the pre-defined integrations are not enough, you can set up a custom [dashboard] to visualize any service metric received by the system, as well as [host metrics][hosts] and span processing metrics.

Kamon APM has a deep understanding of [JVM metrics], the [JDBC], [Cassandra], [Kafka], and more, integrating perfectly with Kamon Telemetry. It provides an easy way to start monitoring [Akka], [Play] or [Spring Boot] out of the box, and gives you understanding of your system and a way to discover and solve errors, slowdowns, and other problems. While the product works best with JVM-based microservices and Kamon Telemetry, but its utility does not end there - with Kamon APM, you can also ingest [OpenTelemetry] traces to monitor any programming language with OpenTelemetry support!

Getting Started
----------------

You can get started with Kamon APM **for free**, in just 3 minutes. You can [sign up] with your e-mail or via Google _without_ having to enter your credit card details. The free Developer plan can be used for free for any duration of time, but will not offer the full range of Kamon APM capabilities. See the list of [plans] for more details.
