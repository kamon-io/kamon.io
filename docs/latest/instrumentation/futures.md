Futures Instrumentation
=======================

The `kamon-futures` module provides bytecode instrumentation for performing automatic Context Propagation with Scala
Futures, as well as utilities to create Spans from a Future's body and callbacks.


Context Propagation
-------------------

In the following piece of code, the body of the future will be executed asynchronously on a thread provided by the
ExecutionContext available in implicit scope and when the code runs, Kamon will capture the current `Context` available
when the future was created and make it available while executing the future's body.

{% code_example %}
{%   language scala instrumentation/futures/src/main/scala/kamon/examples/futures/ContextPropagation.scala tag:future-body %}
{% endcode_example %}

Also, when you transform a future by using map/flatMap/filter and friends or you directly register a callback on a
future (onComplete/onSuccess/onFailure), Kamon will capture the current `Context` available when transforming
the future and make it available when executing the given callback. The code snippet above would print the same
`userID` that was available when creating the future, during its body execution and during the execution of all
the asynchronous operations scheduled on it.


Creating Spans
--------------

It is possible to create Spans that represent an entire asynchronous computation, a Future's body or asynchronous
transformations applied to them by using these functions:

- `trace(operationName: String) { ... }` which accepts a call-by-name block that produces a Future and creates a Span
  that will be automatically finished when the Future finishes.
- `traceBody(operationName: String) { ... }` which accepts a call-by-name block that can be used to wrap the Future body
  and creates a Span that will be automatically finished when the Future's body finishes executing.
- `traceFunc(operationName: String) { ... }` which accepts a function that can be used to wrap any of the transformations
  than can be applied on a Future and creates a Span that will be automatically finished when the transformation finishes
  executing.

The `traceBody` and `traceFunc` functions work very similarly, the only reason for them not being the same is the
mismatch between the types expected when creating a Future and the types expected when applying transformations to them.
Let's see this in a small example:

{% code_example %}
{%   language scala instrumentation/futures/src/main/scala/kamon/examples/futures/ContextPropagation.scala tag:future-spans %}
{% endcode_example %}

In the code example above, the instrumentation will automatically create a Span called `future-body` that measures how
long did it take to execute the Future's body, as well as additional Spans for the `calculate-length` and `to-string`
steps of the computation. Note that even though the rest of the transformations in this example will not get dedicated
Spans, they will still benefit from Context propagation, just as before!

{% include warning.html message="Do not use these functions if you are not running your application without the
instrumentation agent, since that will lead to threads not being properly cleaned up from previous request's Contexts." %}

Manual Installation
