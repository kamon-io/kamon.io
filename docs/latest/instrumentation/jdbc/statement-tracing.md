JDBC Statement Instrumentation
==============================

The JDBC instrumentation will automatically create Spans for Statements, Prepared Statements and Callable Statements
created with the official drivers for these databases (please, drop a line if your database driver is missing!):
  - H2
  - SQLite
  - Postgres
  - MySQL / MariaDB
  - Oracle
  - Microsoft SQL Server


Statement Tracing
-----------------

All Spans created by the instrumentation will at least have the following tags:

  - **db.url**: full JDBC URL used to locate the database.
  - **db.vendor**: name of the JDBC driver vendor.
  - **db.statement**: the full executed statement text.

Additionally, if a supported connection pool is used the following tags will be included as well:
  - **jdbc.pool.vendor**: name of the connection pool vendor, currently we only support HikariCP.
  - **jdbc.pool.name**: name of the connection pool.



Slow Statements Processor
-------------------------

Besides creating Spans, the JDBC instrumentation can also capture statement executions that take longer than a specified
threshold and run them through a `SlowStatementProcessor` implementation. This module ships with a warning logger that
will automatically log a warning message when any statement execution takes longer than 2 seconds. You can tweak the
threshold or change your processor implementation with these settings:

{% code_block typesafeconfig %}
kamon.instrumentation.jdbc.statements {
  slow {

    # Minimum execution time threshold to consider a statement execution
    # as slow. When a statement execution takes longer than this threshold,
    # it will be passed to all all configured processors.
    threshold = 2 seconds

    # Implementations of SlowStatementProcessor that will handle all
    # slow statement executions.
    processors = [
      "your.custom.Implementation"
    ]
  }
}
{% endcode_block %}



Failed Statements Processor
---------------------------

Finally, Kamon can also capture failed statement executions and run them through a `FailedStatementProcessor`
implementation. This module ships with a failed statements processor that logs error messages when a Statement fails.
You can change your processor implementation with these settings:

{% code_block typesafeconfig %}
kamon.instrumentation.jdbc.statements {
  failed {

    # Implementations of FailedStatementProcessor that will handle all
    # failed statement executions.
    processors = [
      "your.custom.Implementation"
    ]
  }
}
{% endcode_block %}


Manual Installation
-------------------

In case you are not using the Kamon Bundle, add the dependency bellow to your build:

{% include dependency-info.html module="kamon-jdbc" version=site.data.versions.latest.jdbc %}
{% include instrumentation-agent-notice.html %}
