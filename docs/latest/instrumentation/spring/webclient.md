Spring WebClient Instrumentation
=======================
Since __2.1.13__

{% alert info %}
This is an experimental feature that is currently enabled by default.
You can disable it by adding `kanela.modules.spring.enabled = no`
to your configuration.
{% endalert %}

Overview
--------

The Spring WebClient instrumentation will automatically create spans for requests sent using Spring WebClient.
All requests will have a name that corresponds to the request type sent by the client, and add HTTP trace and span headers
to the request.

Example span and tags:
