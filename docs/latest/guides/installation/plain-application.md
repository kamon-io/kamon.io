Installation on a Plain Application
===================================

This guide is an "extended" version of the official [Get Started][get-started] steps for a plain application, but here we
dive a little bit more into what is being achieved in each step. By "plain application" we mean any application that
starts from a good old `main` method that you can control, like pretty much all Akka, Akka HTTP and Spring Boot
applications out there.

The general idea stays the same as in the official guide, there are three simple steps to follow:
  1. [Install Kamon](#install-kamon)
  2. [Verify the Installation](#verify-the-installation)
  2. [Install Reporters](#install-reporters)


Install Kamon
-------------

### Add the Bundle Dependency

First of all, add the `kamon-bundle` dependency using your build system of choice. The bundle contains **all** the
instrumentation available in Kamon, it even includes Kanela! (our instrumentation agent). Here is how it would look like
in your build:

{% include dependency-info.html module="kamon-bundle" version=site.data.versions.latest.bundle prefix="plain" %}

The bundle is available for Java 8+ and published for Scala 2.11 and 2.12 (Scala 2.13 will be available shortly). If you
are not familiar with the Scala version suffix then just pick the greatest Scala version available.

### The SBT Plugin

This is only useful if you are an SBT user, so feel free to jump to the next section if this isn't relevant for you.

One super common development practice among SBT users is to just hit `run` on the SBT console a voila, the application
is running right there and then. But, if you want Kanela (our instrumentation agent) to work properly when running from
SBT then you should install the `sbt-kanela-runner` plugin by adding this to your `project/plugins.sbt` file:

{% code_block scala %}
addSbtPlugin("io.kamon" % "sbt-kanela-runner" % "{{ site.data.versions.latest.kanela_runner }}")
{% endcode_block %}

After this, whenever you hit `run` the instrumentation will be applied as expected!


### Initializing Kamon

The last step is to initialize Kamon, which is just about calling `Kamon.init()` as the very first thing when your main
method is invoked:

{% code_example %}
{%   language scala guides/install/sbt/src/main/scala/kamon/example/Start.scala tag:load-modules %}
{%   language kotlin guides/install/gradle/src/main/kotlin/kamon/example/Start.kt tag:load-modules %}
{%   language java guides/install/maven/src/main/java/kamon/example/Start.java tag:load-modules %}
{% endcode_example %}

The initialization process will attach Kanela to the JVM, and find all modules available on the classpath and initialize
them.

{% alert warning %}
<strong>For Scala Developers</strong>: If you are applying mixins directly on your `App` companion object, those mixins might cause
initialization of certain classes before the instrumentation is applied. If this is the case, you can either
reorganize your companion object to ensure that the Kamon initialization comes first, or launch your application with
the -javaagent option.
{% endalert %}


Verify the Installation
-----------------------

Next time you start your application, Kamon should start the Status Page module included in the bundle, which provides a
very convenient way to figure out whether everything is in place or not: just got to
<a href="http://localhost:5266/" target="_blank"><strong>localhost:5266</strong></a> on your browser and something like
this should show up:

{% lightbox /assets/img/kamon-status-page.png %}
Kamon Status Page
{% endlightbox %}

The important bit here is to ensure that modules are loaded and instrumentation is active. As you start adding more and
more metrics modules and custom telemetry to Kamon, you will probably be coming back to this page to verify that all is
working as expected.


Install Reporters
-----------------

At this point, the only thing you are missing is to install some reporters that will take the metrics and trace data
collected by Kamon into an external system. Adding a reporter is just about adding the appropriate dependency to your
build. For example, if you wanted to add the [Kamon APM reporter][apm-reporter] to your build, just add the appropriate dependency:

{% include dependency-info.html module="kamon-apm-reporter" version=site.data.versions.latest.apm prefix="reporter" %}

And that is all, Kamon will automatically pick up the module from the classpath and initialize it during startup! Head
over to the [Reporters Section][reporters] to see all available reporters, including the ones for [Prometheus][prometheus],
[Zipkin][zipkin], [InfluxDB][influxdb], [Datadog][datadog] and several more!
