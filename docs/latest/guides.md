First Steps
===========

These guides are aimed towards getting your feet wet and start getting telemetry data from your services as quick as
possible.

- [**Installing Kamon**][installing-kamon] is the beginning of it all. Here you will learn how to add the Kamon
  libraries and get a basic setup ready for any application you want to instrument with Kamon.
- [**Setting up the Agent**][setting-up-the-agent] has tips and tricks that can help you setup the instrumentation agent
  with your build tool and IDE.


Frameworks
==========

Guides in this section are aimed to getting you from zero to telemetry with a particular framework or toolkit, including
setup, basic configuration and seeing example data in several metrics and tracing solutions.

- The [**elementary Akka setup**][elementary-akka] guide takes one of the most common example Akka applications and
  enables metrics and distributed tracing on it using Kamon's automatic instrumentation.
