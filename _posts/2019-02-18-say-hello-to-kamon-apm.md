Dear community,

We are pleased to announce the availability of Kamon APM, a hosted APM solution built from the ground up to work nicely
with Kamon and along with it we are launching a [Free Starter Plan][pricing]. Starting today there are no excuses
for your team to say that you can't have metrics and distributed tracing in production because, well, you can get it for
free!

There are a few questions that came up while discussing this announcement with friends and coleagues so we decided to
share them here in case you were wondering the same:


#### How will this affect the Kamon community?

The only change we expect to see is a surplus of effort and dedication to our open source instrumentation. We started
Kamon years ago with the intention to help and share with the community and that intention remains unchanged. All the
instrumentation we have written so far is open source and all instrumentation to come in the future will be open source
as well, regardless of whether you are sending your data to Prometheus, Zipkin, Kamon APM or any other open source or
commercial solution.

A key feature that people love about Kamon remains unchanged: __instrument once, report anywhere__.


#### So, you said "free starter plan"?

That is correct. Over time, we learned that the hardest part of all when it comes to monitoring is getting started and
one of the ways in which we can help with this is by providing a simple way to experiment with metrics and distributed
tracing with minimal effort from your side. The starter plan is aimed towards developers wanting to experiment and small
teams getting started with monitoring. [Sign up][sign up] and get started with monitoring in a couple minutes!


#### What happened to Kamino?

The project that you know today as Kamon APM started off as Kamino. Back in the day we were really fixated with the idea
that our open source and commercial solutions had to be completely separated from each other; it was an attempt to make
sure that the community will feel safe to contribute and use our tools without thinking that there is an evil corp
behind it and that you could only access the instrumentation if you pay, which was never the idea.

As it turns out, it is much simpler to just be open with people about what we are trying to do here and formalize
something that is pretty obvious to us since months ago: Kamon and Kamon APM are not two different solutions but rather
two sides of a bigger one.

Given that a great part of making Kamon APM an awesome tool is rooted in making all the open source instrumentation even
more awesome, you can expect us to put a bunch more effort into Kamon and other open source instrumentation libraries.

That's it for today folks, go and have fun with Kamon!
