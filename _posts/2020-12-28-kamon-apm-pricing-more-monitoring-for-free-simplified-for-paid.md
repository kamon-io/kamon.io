    More monitoring for free, simplified pricing for paid.
---


Starting December 2020 we’re simplifying our pricing model.

Everyone signing up for Kamon APM starts with a free plan that now includes monitoring up to 5 microservices.

For growing teams with more complex systems and needs we changed our Grow plan to a simplified pricing of €1 per service
per day.

For a typical user with a couple services that's less than a frappuccino per day. And you get to monitor your 
infrastructure and test environments for free!

And fear not, Kamon Telemetry stays and will always stay open-source and free. These changes are only relevant to Kamon
APM users.

Enjoy your free monitoring!
