If you already had some experience with Kamon, you probably saw Kamon create Spans automatically for a lot of stuff,
including HTTP server requests, database calls, actor messages, and more.

But what happens when you want to create Spans for methods or code blocks that Kamon doesn't instrument automatically?

Let's look at the two simplest ways to create Spans programmatically with Kamon:



## Using the Kamon.span Function

Since Kamon [2.1.21](https://github.com/kamon-io/Kamon/releases/tag/v2.1.21) you can use the `Kamon.span` function to
wrap a code block and create a Span out of it:

{% code_block scala %}
import kamon.Kamon.span

span("myOperationName") {
  // Do your stuff here  
}
{% endcode_block %}

The `span` function creates a new Span with the operation name you passed as argument, and additionally it will: 
  - Store the Span in the current `Context` while the wrapped code block executes. This ensures that other Spans you
    create later on will be connected to the same trace as the current Span.
  - Fail the Span with any exception thrown by the wrapped code block.
  - Finish the Span when the wrapped code block finishes executing. With a little twist: if the wrapped code block
    returns a Scala `Future` or a `CompletionStage`, then the Span will be finished when the asynchronous computation
    finishes.



## Using the @Trace Annotation

If you are into annotations, you are going to like `@Trace`. 

{% code_block scala %}
import kamon.annotation.api.Trace

@Trace
def fetch(...): Future[] = {
  // Do your stuff here  
}
{% endcode_block %}

The `@Trace` annotation takes care of creating the new Span, storing it in the current `Context`, failing it if the
method throws an exception, and finishing it when it returns. If you don't provide any operation name to `@Trace` then
Kamon will generate one using the class and method names.

And, if the annotated method returns a Scala `Future` or a `CompletionStage`, then the created Span will be
finished when the asynchronous computation finishes, just like with the `span` function from above.




#### Configuring Annotation Scanning

There is one configuration requirement for using the `@Trace` annotation: you must tell Kamon which packages to scan for
annotated methods. Include the lines below in your `application.conf` file, pointing to the packages you want Kamon to
scan and you are good to go:

{% code_block typesafeconfig %}
kanela.modules.annotation {
  within += "my.company.*"
}
{% endcode_block %}



## See it in Action

Let's try out these options with a short, but real example. 

Imagine you are working on a service that handles user sessions. To get a session's info the service needs to send
requests to two other services: one to get the user details, and another to get the user permissions. 

The business logic might look similar to this:

{% code_block scala %}

/**
  * This is what gets called from our HTTP handler, and
  * delegates part of the business logic to other helper
  * methods like `fetchUser` and `fetchPermissions`.
  */
def getSessionInfo(sessionID: String): Future[SessionInfo] = {
  for {
    user        <- fetchUser(sessionID)
    permissions <- fetchPermissions(user.id)
  } yield {
    SessionInfo(user, permissions)
  }
}


def fetchUser(sessionID: String): Future[User] =
  Future {
    // There should be a HTTP / Database call here
    User(1, "@kamonteam")
  }


def fetchPermissions(userID: Long): Future[Permissions] =
  Future {
    // There should be a HTTP / Database call here
    Permissions(canBreakThings = true)
  }

{% endcode_block %}

The `getSessionInfo` method is called from the HTTP Server logic, then it calls `fetchUser` and `fetchPermissions`. 

The actual business logic doesn't matter a lot. What really matters is the use case: a piece of business logic that
requires responses from two other services to process a request. 


#### Creating a Span for the Main Logic

At first, we want to figure out how long does it takes to execute the entire `getSessionInfo` logic. We can go ahead and
wrap the `getSessionInfo` method with a `span`:

{% code_block scala %}

/**
  * This is what gets called from our HTTP handler, and
  * delegates part of the business logic to other helper
  * methods like `fetchUser` and `fetchPermissions`.
  */
def getSessionInfo(sessionID: String): Future[SessionInfo] = {
  
  span("getSessionInfo") { // <- This creates the Span

    for {
      user        <- fetchUser(sessionID)
      permissions <- fetchPermissions(user.id)
    } yield {
      SessionInfo(user, permissions)
    }
  }
}
{% endcode_block %}

We put the example code from above behind a `/sessions` endpoint in a tiny Akka HTTP application, just so that we can
send requests and visualize the full trace:


<div class="text-center my-5">
  <img class="img-fluid" src="/assets/img/posts/creating-spans-main-method-only.png" alt="Creating a Single Span Programmatically">
</div>

There are two Spans in this trace:
  - The `/sessions` Span, created automatically by Kamon's Akka HTTP instrumentation.
  - the `getSessionInfo` Span, created with our little code from above.

Not only did we create a custom Span with a single line of code, we got that Span to join the same trace that Kamon had
already running with the automatic instrumentation!


#### Creating Spans for Additional Logic

For debugging purposes, it would be interesting to add another level of detail to this trace: tracking how long it takes
for `fetchUser` and `fetchPermissions` to complete.

Let's make two changes to the example code:
  - Add the `@Trace` annotation to the `fetchUser` method. 
  - Wrap the body of `fetchPermissions` with a `span` block, same as we did get `getSessionInfo` before.

The updated code should look like this:

{% code_block scala %}

@Trace(operationName = "fetchUser")
def fetchUser(sessionID: String): Future[User] =
  Future {
    // There should be a HTTP / Database call here
    User(1, "@kamonteam")
  }


def fetchPermissions(userID: Long): Future[Permissions] =
  span("permissions) {
    Future {
      // There should be a HTTP / Database call here
      Permissions(canBreakThings = true)
    }
  }

{% endcode_block %}

And there they are, two new Spans for these two methods:

<div class="text-center my-5">
  <img class="img-fluid" src="/assets/img/posts/creating-spans-all-methods.png" alt="Creating Spans Programmatically">
</div>



#### Adding Tags to Spans

You can always access the Spans created with the `span` function or the `@Trace` annotation by calling
`Kamon.currentSpan` in the wrapped code block. For example, if you wanted to add the session id as a tag to the
`fetchUser` Span, you can write something like this:

{% code_block scala %}
import kamon.Kamon.currentSpan

@Trace(operationName = "fetchUser")
def fetchUser(sessionID: String): Future[User] =
  Future {

    // Adding a tag to the current Span
    currentSpan().tag("sessionID", sessionID)

    // There should be a HTTP / Database call here
    User(1, "@kamonteam")
  }
{% endcode_block %}

And sure enough, the new tag is going to show up in your traces (see the gree highlight at the bottom-right):

  <img class="img-fluid" src="/assets/img/posts/creating-spans-with-tags.png" alt="Adding Tags to Spans">
</div>


## Bonus: Latency Metrics for Spans

Kamon does a little bit more under the hood than just creating the Spans. By default, Kamon records the latency for all
finished Spans in the `span.processing-time` metric, so that you don't need to repeat instrumentation for metrics and
traces.

The `span.processing-time` metric will always have at least these tags:
  - `operation` with the operation name you assigned when creating the Span.
  - `error` with either true or false, depending on whether the Span finished successfully or not.
  - Any tags you added programmatically by calling `currentSpan().tagMetric(...)`.

To summarize, the few lines of code we added on this post brought us more detailed traces, and metrics for our custom
Spans. 

And there is more! Even though some Spans will be dropped because of trace sampling, Kamon will always record the Span's
duration on the `span.processing-time` metric, so you will always get accurate latency histograms from all your Spans!

By the way, we are working on a piece about how trace sampling works in Kamon. Stay tuned for more!
