In this post we’ll show how to take a simple Scalatra project and set up basic monitoring with Kamon. This is a really
simplified example and also we will skip some issues related to the installation, because there are awesome tutorials
about that. Having said that, let's get to it!



### Build Setup ###

We need to include in our [Build.scala] some dependencies. It should look like this:

{% code_block scala %}

val dependencies = Seq(
    "io.kamon"    	          %% "kamon-core"           	  % "0.4.0",
     // [Optional]
    "io.kamon"    	          %% "kamon-scala"                % "0.4.0",
     // [Optional]
    "io.kamon"    	          %% "kamon-log-reporter"   	  % "0.4.0",
     // ... and so on with all the others dependencies you need.
    )

val main = Project(appName, file(".")).settings(libraryDependencies ++= dependencies)
              .settings(defaultSettings: _*)
              .settings(aspectjSettings ++ AspectJ.aspectjSettings) //(1)
{% endcode_block %}

The only reason why We need to register the [AspectJ] weaver is to automatically propagating the `TraceContext` across the
asynchronous operations that might be scheduled for a given Future.

Also note that there is no `kamon-scalatra` module, everything we are showing in this post is just using the APIs provided by
`kamon-core` to monitor your application. This might also serve as inspiration for other people to get other web frameworks
working with Kamon as well.


### Create a Simple Servlet ###

Let's start by creating a convenient trait that will make it easier to add Kamon [instruments] to our servlets:

{% code_block scala %}
trait KamonSupport {
  def counter(name: String) = Kamon.metrics.counter(name)
  def minMaxCounter(name: String) = Kamon.metrics.minMaxCounter(name)
  def time[A](name: String)(thunk: => A) = Latency.measure(Kamon.metrics.histogram(name))(thunk)
  def traceFuture[A](name:String)(future: => Future[A]):Future[A] =
    Tracer.withContext(Kamon.tracer.newContext(name)) {
     future.andThen { case completed ⇒ Tracer.currentContext.finish() }(SameThreadExecutionContext)
   }
}
{% endcode_block %}

Then we create a Servlet that will record some metrics. In order to achieve this we mix our `KamonSupport` to use the
provided methods.

{% code_block scala %}
class KamonServlet extends ScalatraServlet with KamonSupport with FutureSupport {
  ...
  get("/time") {
    time("time") {
      Thread.sleep(Random.nextInt(100))
    }
  }

  get("/minMaxCounter") {
    minMaxCounter("minMaxCounter").increment()
  }

  get("/counter") {
    counter("counter").increment()
  }

  get("/async") {
    traceFuture("retrievePage") {
      Future {
        HttpClient.retrievePage()
      }
    }
  }
  ...
}
{% endcode_block %}

now we have 5 URLs that we can hit:

* **GET** */kamon/time*
* **GET** */kamon/counter*
* **GET** */kamon/minMaxCounter*
* **GET** */kamon/async*


### Bootstrapping Scalatra with Kamon ###

We will need to bootstrap `Scalatra` and hook `Kamon` into it's lifecycle and the best place for this is using `ScalatraBootstrap`'s
`init` and `destroy` hooks as shown below:

{% code_block scala %}

class ScalatraBootstrap extends LifeCycle {
  override def init(context: ServletContext):Unit = {
    Kamon.start() //(1)
    context.mount(new KamonServlet(), "/kamon")
  }

  override def destroy(context: ServletContext):Unit = {
    Kamon.shutdown() //(2)
  }
}
{% endcode_block %}

1. To access the metrics and tracing APIs, and to ensure that all Kamon modules are loaded you will need to start Kamon
by using the `Kamon.start(..)` method.
2. When you are done with Kamon, remember to shut it down using the
`Kamon.shutdown()` method.

### Select a Kamon Backend ###

This time will we use the [kamon-log-reporter]. This module is not meant to be used in production environments, but it
certainly is a convenient way to test Kamon and know in a quick manner what's going on with our application in
development, moreover like all Kamon modules it will be picked up from the classpath and started at runtime, just by adding the
dependency to our classpath we are good to go.

Additionally we can find more info about how to configure [modules] and supported backends([StatsD], [Datadog], [New
Relic] and [Your Own]) in the docs.


### Start the Server ###

Scalatra uses `Jetty` internally, and it is in itself a simple java servlet. So what we can do is just run an embedded
`Jetty` instance that mounts the servlet and configures it.

{% code_block scala %}
object EmbeddedServer extends App {
  val server = new Server(8080)
  val context: WebAppContext = new WebAppContext()

  context.setServer(server)
  context.setContextPath("/")
  context.setWar("src/webapp")
  server.setHandler(context)

  try {
    server.start()
    server.join()
  } catch {
    case e: Exception =>
      e.printStackTrace()
      System.exit(1)
  }
}
{% endcode_block %}

We can run this application directly by typing `sbt run` from the console. The output we will see will be something like
this if we hit some of the endpoints we've set up.

* **curl** *http://localhost:8080/kamon/time*
* **curl** *http://localhost:8080/kamon/counter*
* **curl** *http://localhost:8080/kamon/minMaxCounter*

### Ok, but show me the money! ###

So far so good. **But what if my route returns a Future?**. The answer is simple: **Kamon has your back**, the
body of the future will be executed asynchronously on some other thread in a provided `ExecutionContext`, but Kamon,
through bytecode instrumentation, will capture the `TraceContext` available when the Future was created and make it
available while executing the future’s body.

Let's run the application with `sbt run` and we measure the async operation.

* **curl** *http://localhost:8080/kamon/async*

### Enjoy! ###

There it is, all your metrics data available to be sent into whatever tool you like. From here, you should be able to
instrument your applications as needed.

We also encourage you to review the full source code of [Scalatra Kamon Example] used in this tutorial.
