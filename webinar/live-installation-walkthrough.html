        <h2>On this Webinar</h2>
        <p class="px-0">
          You'll learn how to use Kamon to instrument an Akka HTTP application and generate the basic 
          telemetry data every microservice should expose:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Throughput, latency, and error metrics from your HTTP server</li>
          <li>JVM metrics to track memory usage and garbage collection times</li>
          <li>Instrument client calls to other microservices, databases, and external APIs</li>
          <li>Include trace ids and other context information in your logs</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="px-0">
          The live walkthrough is based on Akka HTTP, but roughly the same steps will work out with Play and 
          Lagom Framework applications so feel free to join and learn!
        </p>
