          You'll learn how to use Kamon to instrument an Akka HTTP application and generate the basic 
          telemetry data every microservice should expose:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Throughput, latency, and error metrics from your HTTP server</li>
          <li>JVM metrics to track memory usage and garbage collection times</li>
          <li>Instrument client calls to other microservices, databases, and external APIs</li>
          <li>Include trace ids and other context information in your logs</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="px-0">
          The live walkthrough is based on Akka HTTP, but roughly the same steps will work out with Play and 
          Lagom Framework applications so feel free to join and learn!

          Ivan will be doing the live walkthough and answering any questions you might have. Ivan is the 
          founder @ Kamon, where he has poured almost a decade of efforts into instrumenting and monitoring applications 
          built with Akka, Play Framework, and the JVM in general.
        </p>
        <p>
          As part of the Kamon team, Ivan works closely with 
          developers to go from zero to production-ready observability with Kamon
