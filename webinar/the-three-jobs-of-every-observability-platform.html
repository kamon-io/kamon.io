        <h2>On this Webinar</h2>

        <p class="px-0">
          On this webinar we will depart from the buzzwords and marketing around observability to focus on
          the three jobs that your observability platform must help you get done:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Instrument your applications to produce telemetry data</li>
          <li>Monitor your system's vitals so that you know when something goes wrong</li>
          <li>Dig through telemetry data to debug any problem that might come your way</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="px-0">
          We will also touch on the most common telemetry data types (logs, metrics, and traces), how
          each one of them is better suited for monitoring or debugging tasks, and the common gotchas
          you must take into account when building your observability platform.
        </p>
