Dear community, we just published Kamon 0.6.1 which has a few minor bug fixes and a correctly published `kamon-akka-remote`
module for Akka 2.4.

Thanks to [Jo√£o Ferreira](https://github.com/jtjeferreira) we now have a new Elasticsearch module! We are looking forward
to your feedback with regards to this module, take a look at the [related docs](/integrations/databases/elasticsearch/)
and give it a try.

For people using Akka 2.4, you can now safely use `kamon-akka-remote_akka-2.4` without having workaround the wrong
dependencies that were published with Kamon 0.6.0 (sorry about that :/).

Thanks a lot to everyone who provided feedback, fixes and even new modules, we really appreciate your enthusiasm!
Without anything else to say, here is the changelog extract for this release:

* kamon-core:
  * Add tags for Traces. (see issue [#327](https://github.com/kamon-io/Kamon/issues/327)).
  * Catch any exception being thrown when recording values on histograms. see [pull #335](https://github.com/kamon-io/Kamon/pull/335)).

* kamon-newrelic:
  * Update newrelic-agent dependency. (see [pull #330](https://github.com/kamon-io/Kamon/pull/330)).

* kamon-statsd:
  * in "normalize" strategy - add replace(":", "-") after replace(": ", "-") to cover the remotely deployed actors case. (see [pull #325](https://github.com/kamon-io/Kamon/pull/325)).

* kamon-elasticsearch:
  * We have a new Elasticsearch integration! (see [pull #309](https://github.com/kamon-io/Kamon/pull/309)).
