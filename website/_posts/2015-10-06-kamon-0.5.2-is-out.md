Dear users,

Kamon 0.5.2 is out! This is a minor update containing just a handful of changes, mostly bug fixes.



Here is a little excerpt from our [changelog] for this release:

* kamon-core:
  * Avoid NPE thrown if you shutdown Kamon and it wasn't started yet. (see [pull #263](https://github.com/kamon-io/Kamon/pull/263)).

* kamon-newrelic:
  * Fix a match error when non-http client segments are recorded. (see issue [#253](https://github.com/kamon-io/Kamon/issues/253)).
  * Support for multiple application names. (see issue [#255](https://github.com/kamon-io/Kamon/issues/255)).

* kamon-system-metrics:
  * Ensure that heap metrics collect new instances of `MemoryUsage` rather than keeping the first seen instance. (see [pull #260](https://github.com/kamon-io/Kamon/pull/260)).


If you were waiting for these changes then the time to enjoy has come!
