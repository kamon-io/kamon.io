Reporting Metrics to New Relic
==============================

[New Relic] is a well know and widely spread Application Performance Management provider that, among other platforms,
supports monitoring applications running on the JVM. Although New Relic has it's own instrumentation agent that
introduces their proprietary tracing and metrics code, we found many of our users wanting to send their metrics data to
New Relic, so we delivered :).

<p class="alert alert-info">This is not an official New Relic product, and is not endorsed by New Relic.</p>


Installation
-------------

Add the `kamon-newrelic` dependency to your project and ensure that it is in your classpath at runtime, that's it.
Kamon's module loader will detect that the New Relic module is in the classpath and automatically start it.


Configuration
-------------

There are two main items that you need to configure to get up and running: Your application name, set via the
`kamon.newrelic.app-name` configuration setting and your New Relic license via the `kamon.newrelic.license-key`
configuration setting.


Integration Notes
-----------------

This module will only report a small subset of the of the available metrics, namely:

* __Web Transaction Metrics__: That are generated by using all the traces that are measured from your application.
* __External Services__:  Generated by using all segments that have the `http-client` category.
* __Apdex__: Currently a single Apdex value is being reported as an aggregate of traces in your application. You can use
the `kamon.newrelic.apdexT` configuration setting to change the Apdex-T value, which defaults to one second.
* __Custom Metrics__: All single-intrument entities are reported as custome metrics to New Relic. Please keep in mind that
you will need a New Relic paid subscription to see custom metrics for your application.


Visualization and Fun
---------------------

New Relic has a set of predefined dashboards with fixed metric categories on them that will allow you to see the metrics
reported by the `kamon-newrelic` module without you having to do anything on the New Relic side. Here are a few screenshots
of how your traces and segments will look like in the New Relic dashboards:
